ForestVision
============

ForestVision extends [TorchGeo](https://github.com/microsoft/torchgeo) datasets and samplers to support cloud-based geospatial data services. Currently supports Google Earth Engine (GEE) datasets through an abstract class `GEERasterDataset`, which allows to pre-process and retrieve GEE imagery and combine it with TorchGeo native geospatial datasets. Future releases will incorporate demo pipelines for training and predicting forest community composition and structural characteristics from remote sensing data.
